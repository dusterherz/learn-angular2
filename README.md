# angular2-learning

My answer to the tutorial of Angular 2
(https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/)

# Why this on GitHub ?

I like to have a clean project and to work by functionnality. It can also serve to show that I really learned Angular 2. Also, I work with two computers (one at work and one at home), and it's more easy to share the file this way.

# Why Angular 2 ?

I learned Angular JS in 2015 and I like it, although I sometime was quite angry and frustrated on how the framework work, which Angular 2 seems to correct. I think Angular 2 became more and more popular and can be a nice advantage for a recruiting. Also, this is what my colleagues at work are used to.

# How far am I ?

I have finished it.
